# Astrid: Advanced Analytics and Metric Gathering with Identification

Astrid is an open-source platform designed for advanced analytics and metric gathering with secure user identification. It empowers organizations to gain deep insights into user behavior and improve decision-making.

Astrid is not a tool for spying. It prioritizes transparency and user control over data collection, offering:

- Clear consent mechanisms: Users actively opt-in to sharing their data.
- Fine-grained access control: Organizations customize what data is collected and who can access it.
- Data retention policies: Users control how long their data is stored.

## Components:
- Zephyr (backend): A secure Python Flask API built with FastAPI principles, handling data processing, storage, and user management.
- Vega (client-side): A lightweight JavaScript library offering:
  - Device fingerprinting for secure user identification.
  - Secure data transmission via HTTPS.
  - Flexible integration with various platforms through API wrappers.

## Benefits:
- Comprehensive analytics: Capture and analyze user behavior across diverse platforms.
- Enhanced security: Secure user identification and data protection.
- Customization and flexibility: Integrate with any platform through Vega's API wrappers.
- Open-source transparency: Build trust with open-source development and clear documentation.

## Use cases:
- Website and app analytics: Understand user journeys and optimize engagement.
- Fraud detection and prevention: Identify and mitigate suspicious activity.
- Market research and customer insights: Gain valuable insights into user preferences.
- Cybersecurity threat detection: Analyze user behavior to identify potential threats.
